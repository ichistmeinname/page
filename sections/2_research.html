<ul class="itemize">
<li class="freeproving">The <a href="https://github.com/FreeProving">FreeProving</a> projects aims at modelling non-strict effectful programs in the proof assistant Coq to formalise properties of such programs. We currently have a <a href="https://github.com/FreeProving/free-compiler">prototype compiler</a> that transforms Haskell code into Coq using a representation based on free monads. The semantics correspond to call-by-name. The general idea and basic transformation scheme is explained in the publication <a href="#Monad">One Monad to Prove Them All</a>, which is set in a fairy-tale theme. The succeeding publication <a href="#Verifying">Verifying Effectful Haskell Programs Using Coq</a> sets the focus on more complex effects like error messages and tracing as well as advanced Haskell constructs like strict fields. A current topic for future work involves a representation that models call-by-need in order to prove properties about Haskell programs containing tracing effects, or Curry programs that entail non-determinism as an effect.
