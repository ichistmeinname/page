  The combination of non-determinism and sorting is mostly associated
  with permutation sort, a sorting algorithm that is not very useful
  for sorting and has an awful running time. In this paper we look at
  the combination of non-determinism and sorting in a different light:
  given a sorting function, we apply it to a non-deterministic
  predicate to gain a function that enumerates permutations of the
  input list. We get to the bottom of necessary properties of the
  sorting algorithms and predicates in play as well as discuss
  variations of the modelled non-determinism.
  
  On top of that, we formulate and prove a theorem stating that no
  matter which sorting function we use, the corresponding permutation
  function enumerates all permutations of the input list. We use free
  theorems, which are derived from the type of a function alone, to
  prove the statement.
