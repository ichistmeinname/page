  This paper presents PFLP, a library for probabilistic programming in
  the functional logic programming language Curry. It demonstrates how
  the concepts of a functional logic programming language support the
  implementation of a library for probabilistic programming.
  
  In fact, the paradigms of functional logic and probabilistic
  programming are closely connected. That is, we can apply techniques
  from one area to the other and vice versa. We will see that an
  implementation based on the concepts of functional logic programming
  can have benefits with respect to performance compared to a standard
  list-based implementation.
