  We show how various Haskell language features that are related to
  ambient e ects can be modeled in Coq. For this purpose we build on
  previous work that demonstrates how to reason about existing Haskell
  programs by translating them into monadic Coq programs. A model of
  Haskell programs in Coq that is polymorphic over an arbitrary monad
  results in non-strictly positive types when transforming recursive
  data types likes lists. Such non-strictly positive types are not
  accepted by Coqâ€™s termination checker. Therefore, instead of a model
  that is generic over any monad, the approach we build on uses a
  specific monad instance, namely the free monad in combination with
  containers, to model various kinds of e ects. This model allows
  effect-generic proofs.
  
  In this paper we consider ambient effects that may occur in Haskell,
  namely partiality, errors, and tracing, in detail. We observe that,
  while proving propositions that hold for all kinds of effects is
  attractive, not all propositions of interest hold for all kinds of
  effects. Some propositions fail for certain e ects because the
  usual monadic translation models call-by-name and not call-by-need. Since
  modeling the evaluation semantics of call-by-need in the presence
  of e ects like partiality is complex and not necessary to prove
  propositions for a variety of effects, we identify a specific class
  of effects for which we cannot observe a di erence between
  call-by-name and call-by-need. Using this class of effects we can
  prove propositions for all effects that do not require a model of
  sharing.
