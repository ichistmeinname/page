  One Monad to Prove Them All is a modern fairy tale about curiosity
  and perseverance, two important properties of a successful PhD
  student. We follow the PhD student Mona on her adventure of proving
  properties about Haskell programs in the proof assistant Coq.
  </br>
  On the one hand, as a PhD student in computer science Mona observes
  an increasing demand for correct software products. In particular,
  because of the large amount of existing software, verifying existing
  software products becomes more important. Verifying programs in the
  functional programming language Haskell is no exception. On the
  other hand, Mona is delighted to see that communities in the area of
  theorem proving are becoming popular. Thus, Mona sets out to learn
  more about the interactive theorem prover Coq and verifying Haskell
  programs in Coq.
  </br>
  To prove properties about a Haskell function in Coq, Mona has to
  translate the function into Coq code. As Coq programs have to be
  total and Haskell programs are often not, Mona has to model
  partiality explicitly in Coq. In her quest for a solution Mona  nds
  an ancient manuscript that explains how properties about Haskell
  functions can be proven in the proof assistant Agda by translating
  Haskell programs into monadic Agda programs. By instantiating the
  monadic program with a concrete monad instance the proof can be
  performed in either a total or a partial setting. Mona discovers
  that the proposed transformation does not work in Coq due to a
  restriction in the termination checker. In fact the transformation
  does not work in Agda anymore as well, as the termination checker in
  Agda has been improved.
  </br>
  We follow Mona on an educational journey through the land of
  functional programming where she learns about concepts like free
  monads and containers as well as basics and restrictions of proof
  assistants like Coq. These concepts are well-known individually, but
  their interplay gives rise to a solution for Mona’s problem based on
  the originally proposed monadic tranformation that has not been
  presented before. When Mona starts to test her approach by proving a
  statement about simple Haskell functions, she realizes that her
  approach has an additional advantage over the original idea in
  Agda. Mona’s final solution not only works for a speci c monad
  instance but even allows her to prove monad-generic
  properties. Instead of proving properties over and over again for
  speci c monad instances she is able to prove properties that hold
  for all monads representable by a container-based instance of the
  free monad. In order to strengthen her con dence in the
  practicability of her approach, Mona evaluates her approach in a
  case study that compares two implementations for queues. In order to
  share the results with other functional programmers the fairy tale
is available as a literate Coq file.
  </br>
  If you are a citizen of the land of functional programming or are at
  least familiar with its customs, had a journey that involved
  reasoning about functional programs of your own, or are just a
  curious soul looking for the next story about monads and proofs,
then this tale is for you.
