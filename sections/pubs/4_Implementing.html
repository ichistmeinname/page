  This paper presents PFLP, a library for probabilistic programming in
  the functional logic programming language Curry. It demonstrates how
  the concepts of a functional logic programming language support the
  implementation of a library for probabilistic programming. In fact,
  the paradigms of functional logic and probabilistic programming are
  closely connected. That is, language characteristics from one area
  exist in the other and vice versa. For example, the concepts of
  non-deterministic choice and call-time choice as known from
  functional logic programming are related to and coincide with
  stochastic memoization and probabilistic choice in probabilistic
  programming, respectively.

  We will further see that an implementation based on the concepts of
  functional logic programming can have benefits with respect to
  performance compared to a standard list-based implementation and can
  even compete with full-blown probabilistic programming languages,
  which we illustrate by several benchmarks. Under consideration in
  Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).
