I'm a 5th year PhD Student at the <a href="https://www.ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/en/team/m-sc-sandra-dylus">Programming Languages and Compiler Construction</a> group at the University of Kiel. My main interest lies in <b>functional programming</b>. This interest comes in different flavours.

<div class="column about-me">
  As my group develops the <b>functional logic programming language</b> Curry <a href="http://curry-lang.org"><span class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></span></a>, I take every challenge to ease the usage of the language for new users. I'm also always looking for domains that are especially well-suited regarding the usage of functional logic programming features.

<div class="column about-me">
  My first language of choice, however, is the <b>functional language</b> Haskell <a href="https://haskell.org"><span class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></span></a>. When I learn about new techniques, I'll try them in Haskell first. As one of Curry's compilers generates Haskell code, I am also interested in finding the best represention of functional logic features in Haskell.

<div class="column about-me">
I'm also very keen about <b>dependently-typed programming</b> in Coq <a href="https://coq.inria.fr"><span class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></span></a>. Coq is my go-to-language when it comes to proving properties about my functional programs or formalising any theory of a programming language.
