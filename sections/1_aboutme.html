I received my PhD at the <em>Programming Languages and Compiler Construction</em> group at the University of Kiel in February 2020. My main interest lies in <strong>functional programming</strong>. This interest comes in different flavours.

As my group develops the <strong>functional logic programming language</strong> Curry <a href="http://curry-lang.org"><span class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></span></a>, I take every challenge to ease the usage of the language for new users. I’m also always looking for domains that are especially well-suited regarding the usage of functional logic programming features.

My first language of choice, however, is the <strong>functional language</strong> Haskell <a href="https://haskell.org"><span class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></span></a>. When I learn about new techniques, I’ll try them in Haskell first. As one of Curry’s compilers generates Haskell code, I am also interested in finding the best represention of functional logic features in Haskell.

I’m also very keen about <strong>dependently-typed programming</strong> in Coq <a href="https://coq.inria.fr"><span class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></span></a>. Coq is my go-to-language when it comes to proving properties about my functional programs or formalising any theory of a programming language.
